# Diego Ontiveros - Personal Website

Here is found the repo that hosts my personal website. I've used a template designed by <a href="https://bootstrapmade.com/">BootstrapMade</a> but I added my personal touches and sections. It's been a journey since I don't know much about web development, but this project has helped me to deepen my understansing into HTML/CSS/JS and bootstrap frameworks.

If you want to try make your own, it's very easy! 

- You need a GitHub account ([sign up here](https://github.com/join)). If you sign up with username `janedoe` then your website will be `http://janedoe.github.io`, so take that in mind.

- If you like this desing, you can *fork* this repository and rename it to `<yourusername>.github.io`. Make sure GitHub pages is activated in the repo configuration.

- If want to try another desing or start from zero, create the repository named `<yourusername>.github.io` and add all the code there, again making sure GitHub pages is activated.

- Finally, modify the files and customize the website to make it your own, and wen commiting the changes, GitHub will be automatticaly deplying it and updating it. 

Take in mind that in GitHub only static websites can be hosted, so no server operations nor backend scripts are allowed, mainly use HTML/CSS/JS and you'll be fine. Here is more info about [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages)
